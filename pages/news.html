            <h2>Pay attention to that gravel!</h2>
            <img src="../images/gravel.jpg" alt="News 1 Image" class="newsImg">
            <p>A Gravel Bike, also known as Gravel Cycle or Gravel Bicycle, is an immensely versatile bike that combines the best features of road bikes and mountain bikes. Designed for various surfaces, these bikes blend the speed of a road bike with the stability and comfort of a mountain bike. What might look like an aerodynamic road bike is much more – even on rugged terrain, your GHOST Gravel Bike delivers stable performance.</p>
            <p>With a Gravel Bike, your terrain options are almost limitless. Whether asphalt, gravel, dirt roads, or rough terrain – the Gravel Bicycle can handle it all. It is the ideal bicycle for bikers who like to plan their routes off the beaten path but still want to be fast and agile. Compared to mountain bikes, Gravels are incredibly light, which is why our Askets are equipped with a carbon fork.</p>
            <p>The equipment of your Gravel Bike is crucial for riding comfort. In addition to Gravel Bike bags for your luggage, a Gravel Bike with luggage racks offers extra storage space. Mudguards for your Gravel Bike keep you clean and dry, while a specific Gravel Bike handlebar ensures a comfortable riding position. This is particularly important for ergonomically and back-friendly bike tours.</p>
            <p>When buying a Gravel Bike, there are several things to consider. In addition to the price and your preferred purpose, it's also essential to decide if you want an e Gravel Bike with a motor or a classic Gravel. Other factors to consider include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide whether you prefer a Gravel Bike made of carbon or aluminum. Carbon is lighter and more flexible, while aluminum is more durable and usually cheaper.</li>
                <li>Choose the right size. A too small or large bike can significantly impair riding comfort. Use our size calculator, available online next to each bike.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to a good braking system. With the varying conditions a Gravel Bike can master, reliable brakes are essential.</li>
